College Software Engineering project. Worked with three other people. The project is a game that teaches elementary school kids how to spell. The teacher can add students to track their progress and add words to the game. The project helped me learn lots of things. I saw a representation on how a days work will be. I learned agile methodology, and other team building skills.
