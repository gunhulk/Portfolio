# Senior Project - Capstone 
https://github.com/gunhulk/Portfolio/tree/master/Senior%20Project

You can explore the finished project by going to galaxychores.com. It was created with Google Firebase, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. This project proves I understand all the computer science learning goals and all the college wide learning goals. This project was created from scratch by me. It was something I always wanted to accomplish. Creating a full stack project all by myself. My capstone proves I can do this. It shows my technical, creativity, problem solving, and many other skills.


# Spelic
https://github.com/gunhulk/Portfolio/tree/master/Spelic

College Software Engineering project. Worked with three other people. The project is a game that teaches elementary school kids how to spell. The teacher can add students to track their progress and add words to the game. The project helped me learn lots of things. I saw a representation on how a days work will be. I learned agile methodology, and other team building, communication skills.

# People Tracker 
https://github.com/gunhulk/Portfolio/tree/master/Computer%20Vision%20People%20Tracker

This was my final project for computer vision. I decided to create a person tracking program. When ran, the program will open the camera on your CPU by default. The program outlines a box around every object it thinks is a person. This project is very accurate and can track multiple people at once in real time. If you desire to track people in a video/ picture/ movie instead, you can do that as well and it will track all the people in the desired media in real time.

# Virtual Memory Manager  
https://github.com/gunhulk/Portfolio/tree/master/Virtual%20Memory%20Manager

This was my final project for operating systems. The program translates addresses, it proves my understanding in operating systems. It covers algorthms, methods, and other important technical things that operating system programs use. This was written all in C while using the linux command line, though the program does not need to be ran in a linux system.

# ImageEqualization 
https://github.com/gunhulk/Portfolio/tree/master/ImageEqualization

Python Program that equalizes the color of an image. It is an advanced problem that I am proud of solving. The problem shows technical skills I have learned, and is a fun program to show off.
