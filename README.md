# Senior Project - Capstone
You can explore the finished project by going to galaxychores.com. It was created with Google Firebase, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. This project proves I understand all the computer science learning goals and all the college wide learning goals. This project was created from scratch by me. It was something I always wanted to accomplish. Creating a full stack project all by myself. My capstone proves I can do this. It shows my technical, creativity, problem solving, and many other skills.

# Spelic
College Software Engineering project. Worked with three other people. The project is a game that teaches elementary school kids how to spell. The teacher can add students to track their progress and add words to the game. The project helped me learn lots of things. I saw a representation on how a days work will be. I learned agile methodology, and other team building skills. 

# ImageEqualization
Python Program that equalizes the color of an image. It is an advanced problem that I am proud of solving. The problem shows technical skills I have learned, and shows that I understand the Python language.
