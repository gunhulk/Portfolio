# Spelic
College Software Engineering project. Worked with three other people. The project is a game that teaches elementary school kids how to spell. The teacher can add students to track their progress and add words to the game. The project helped me learn lots of things. I saw a representation on how a days work will be. I learned agile methodology, and other team building skills. 

# ImageEqualization
Python Program that equalizes the color of an image. It is an advanced problem that I am proud of solving. The problem shows technical skills I have learned, and shows that I understand the Python language. It is the most recent project I have done.
